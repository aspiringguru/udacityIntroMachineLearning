## Introduction

The Enron scandal, publically revealed in October 2001, led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, the largest corporate bankruptcy in America at the time. The failure of auditor Arthur Anderson to discharge their professional duties led to the defacto dissolution of one of the largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world.

Many Enron executives were charged and sentenced to prison for their acts in the case. 

In 2005 the documentry film "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room" was made about Enron case.
